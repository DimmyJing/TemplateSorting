# TemplateSorting

Why sort a list at runtime when you could sort it at compile time

Sample output:

```
Template sorting: 27 32 33 35 35 46 54 77 92 98
0.000222ms
Normal sorting:   27 32 33 35 35 46 54 77 92 98 
0.01161ms
```

As you can see, template sorting is more than 52 times faster in runtime.
